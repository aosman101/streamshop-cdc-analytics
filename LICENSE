# Step-by-step build guide (with code + explanations)

Below is an “implementation path” that results in a working end-to-end demo quickly, then layers on realism (upserts, dbt tests, CI).

---

## Step 1 — Scaffold the repo
Create this structure first:

```text
streamshop-cdc-analytics/
├─ docker/
│  ├─ postgres/init/
│  ├─ clickhouse/init/
│  ├─ generator/
│  └─ consumer/
├─ connectors/
├─ scripts/
├─ src/
│  ├─ generator/
│  └─ consumer/
├─ dbt/
│  └─ streamshop/
└─ docker-compose.yml
```
